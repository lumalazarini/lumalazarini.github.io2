{{< fa plane >}}  Traveling
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Studying abroad in Italy during Fall 2024 gave me the opportunity to fulfill a lifelong dream of exploring Europe. I visited unforgettable places like London, Paris, Nice, Croatia, Ibiza, and many cities across Italy. Below is a glimpse into four months of travel across Europe.

Growing up with parents who owned a restaurant and were passionate about trying new foods, I developed a love for exploring new cuisines as well. Here are some of my favorite dishes I've enjoyed this year.

{{< fa umbrella-beach >}}  Beach
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The beach is my happy place. It’s where I go to clear my mind and unwind from daily stress. In Isla Vista, you’ll often find me at Sands Beach, just a short walk from campus. When I’m home in San Diego, I love going to Windansea or Solana Beach, my favorites of all time.
