### Groundwater Analyses and the Environment (ENVS193 GW)

This course introduced the fundamentals of groundwater hydrology, including the hydrologic cycle, aquifer geology, and principles of groundwater flow and storage. I explored groundwater management strategies through California policies, applied quantitative methods to analyze basin conditions, and gained an introduction to ArcGIS for mapping aquifers.

### Statistics for Environmental Science (ENVS 193DS)

This course introduced concepts in probability, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing through the lens of environmental science. I learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize data using R and RStudio. I also developed skills in interpreting statistical results, evaluating assumptions, and clearly communicating findings, both visually and in writing, making this course especially relevant for data-driven environmental work.
